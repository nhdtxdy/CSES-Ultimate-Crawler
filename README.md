# CSES-Ultimate-Crawler
 
Clone the whole CSES.fi problemset, including **full testdata!** 😎😱

To use this tool, you first need to use an intercepting proxy to get your CSES session id, and CSRF token. Then, simply replace those variables in the code and run
 
```sh
$ python3 make_pdf.py
$ python3 main.py
```
